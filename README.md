Description:
- The game "Bounce Tiny Ball" is probably lighthearted and fun, with the player controlling a tiny ball that bounces inside a short area. Reaching a high score, avoiding obstacles, or keeping the ball bouncing for as long as possible could be the objectives.

Instruction:
- Controls: Typically, you control the ball using either keyboard arrow keys, touchscreen swipes, or device tilting, depending on the platform (PC, mobile, etc.).
- Bouncing: The ball automatically bounces when it hits a surface. Your task is to control its direction and trajectory to avoid obstacles or reach specific targets.
- Obstacles: The game may feature various obstacles that you need to navigate around, such as spikes, barriers, or moving objects.
- Power-ups: Some versions of bouncing ball games include power-ups like speed boosts, extra lives, or shields to enhance gameplay.
- Scoring: Points are typically awarded based on the time the ball stays in play, the number of obstacles passed, or other achievements. The longer you keep the ball bouncing, the higher your score.
- Levels: The game may have different levels with increasing difficulty, introducing new challenges and obstacles as you progress.
- the specifics can vary, and the actual "Bounce Tiny Ball" game you're referring to might have unique features or gameplay elements.
